# Open-Source-Mafia

## SSM Abstract

Free Open Source Software (FOSS) and Humanitarian Free Open Source Software (H/FOSS) have been a steady trend in the last ten years. For our capstone project, our group worked with git and a Python project, Sugarlabs, to contribute to their H/FOSS project. Sugarlabs is an activity based, open source learning platform for children in underdeveloped areas of the world. They were key in the deployment of the “One Laptop per Child” initiative that was started in the early 2000s. We focused on the Music Blocks activity from Sugarlabs, which is a music creation application that is built similarly to the Scratch programming language with music blocks that can be built into musical output. Our group focused on the examples folder and the need for a README document to describe all the examples that have been made for Musicblocks.
